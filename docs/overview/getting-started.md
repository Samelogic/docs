There are 2 ways to implementing the micro-survey in your app:

- [Using an Editor](micro-survey/product/getting-started.md): For quickly configuring and installing a Micro-Survey.
- [Using NPM packages](micro-survey/library/getting-started.md): For developers who would want more control over implementation.
