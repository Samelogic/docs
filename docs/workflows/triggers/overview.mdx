A trigger describes an event or sequence of events that need to happen to start a Workflow.

Various properties can filter an event to fine-tune the trigger even further. Please see [Filters documentation](./triggers/filters) for more detailed explanation.

Events can be arranged in a sequence that represents complex user flows that might need to happen to trigger a workflow.
