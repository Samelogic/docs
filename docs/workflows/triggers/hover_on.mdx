The Hover On event is configured by a single input field representing the element using [cssSelectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors).
When the browser's native click hover is fired, this Hover On event will fire.

An example of a cssSelector is using the element ID such as `#my-element-id`, where `my-element-id` is the element's ID.
