Workflows make it easy to automate various steps that should happen during an experiment.

### Triggers

Triggers are defined as a list of events that occur in the application to start the workflow. Please see [Triggers Overview documentation](./workflows/triggers) for more details.

### Steps

Steps are defined as a group of actions that are executed after a workflow is triggered.

Steps are **asynchronous**. The initialization of a step can happen via a trigger or other step events.
Steps contain events that are fired based on their specification. Please refer to their docs for more details on what events they expose and under what criteria they are fired.
